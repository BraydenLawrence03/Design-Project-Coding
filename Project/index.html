        <div class="ae" style="position:absolute; right: 100px; top: -150px;">About Me
        <div class="p1" style="position:absolute; right: 700px; top: 800px;">For those who have just started their journey my name is Brayden Lawrence. I created this website as a project for my design class but I mainly
            created this website to provide a small guide for those who are just starting out. As someone who came into being gluten free without knowing much I would have loved a guide to give me whatever I needed. So, to help those
            who are like me, I decided to make this webiste.

        <br>
        <div class="par" style="position:absolute; right: -400px; top: 400px;">I was diagnosed as celiac when I was 7 years old. Both me and my family struggled at first as we were so new to going gluten free. Luckily, with the help of lots of hours spent on research
            and lots of books purchased we managed to get used to the lifestyle. As of writing this on january 7th I am 14 years old and have lived with being celiac for 7 years now..
